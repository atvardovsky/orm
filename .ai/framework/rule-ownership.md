# Rule Ownership

This file is generated from `framework/rule-registry.json`. Per-rule canonical
owners define rule semantics. Category routing owners group related rules for
maintainers and tools but do not become additional semantic owners.
Derived documents should reference the owner or rule ID and avoid copying
the complete policy language.

## Ownership Rules

- Change the canonical owner document before changing a rule summary.
- Keep installer, template, bridge, and help wording as short references.
- Keep owner front matter aligned with registered IDs and dependencies.
- Record material contract changes in the changelog and migration evidence.
