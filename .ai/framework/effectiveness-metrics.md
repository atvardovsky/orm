# Effectiveness Metrics

Effectiveness metrics help evaluate whether Alatyr Core improves AI-assisted
work compared with ordinary assistant instructions.

Metrics are evidence, not a guarantee. They should be collected during pilots,
adapter rechecks, conformance runs, or repeated project tasks.

## Pilot Comparison

Compare similar tasks across:

- no Alatyr adapter
- minimal Alatyr adapter
- full Alatyr adapter

Use the same target repository shape and task intent when possible.

Do not generalize a narrow-task result to broad project work. A representative
pilot should cover the task classes defined by the source repository's
`conformance/benchmarks/benchmark-task-suite.json`, use repeated runs where
assistant variability matters, and preserve independent review for every
adapter mode. The suite definition is planning evidence, not execution
evidence.

## Suggested Metrics

Track:

- context files loaded
- approximate context volume
- input/output tokens and monetary cost when host or billing evidence exists
- context budget exceeded, expansion count, and context receipt reuse
- clarification count
- approvals requested
- validation commands or manual checks run
- hallucinated commands avoided or produced
- missed companion updates
- changed facts identified, consistency relationships reviewed, companion
  surfaces checked, and unresolved consistency gaps
- documentation, diagram, prompt, gate, or bridge sync repairs
- rework count
- residual risks reported
- time to usable result
- protected changes blocked before approval
- activated change packages, evidence quality, and reapproval events
- implementation discoveries or corrections that invalidated scope
- duration to usable result when comparable timing is available
- human architectural interventions, independent Alatyr findings, findings
  derived after human direction, independently initiated versus human-requested
  dependency checks, maintainer corrections, and post-review rework when an
  explicitly activated Debug Mode record provides normalized event evidence;
  architectural counts require structured impact classification, and direction
  replacements retain their correction, rejected-hypothesis, and replacement
  causal chain

Debug Mode is one optional evidence source for these measures. Compare only
completed records with compatible task classes, capture coverage, timing evidence,
observer effect, and independent result-quality review. A lower intervention
count alone is not proof of improved architecture reasoning.

## Source-Repository Tooling

The AlatyrCore source repository includes
`tools/summarize_effectiveness_reports.py` for validating and summarizing JSON
or JSONL effectiveness reports during pilots or conformance work. The helper
is evidence tooling only; it does not prove broad framework quality and is not
a portable target validation requirement.

`tools/report_context_costs.py` provides a deterministic static baseline from
the target context-router template. It measures resolved file and whitespace
word counts, not model tokens or real assistant usage. Compare those static
costs with captured assistant-run context evidence before making runtime cost
claims.

For paired runtime pilots, `tools/prepare_effectiveness_benchmark.py` accepts
explicit no/minimal/full repository snapshots and rejects differences outside
declared adapter surfaces. Companion check and summary tools require matching
task/run identities and independently reviewed acceptance criteria. They
report negative or non-computable deltas directly and do not infer savings
from missing measurements.

## Rejection Criteria

Reject effectiveness claims that:

- compare unrelated tasks
- ignore increased context cost
- hide skipped validation
- count generated volume as quality
- treat one successful run as proof of broad reliability
