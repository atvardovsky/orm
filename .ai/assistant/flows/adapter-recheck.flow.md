# Adapter Recheck Flow

Use this flow after installing or updating Alatyr Core in `Doctrine ORM`, or
when the programmer asks whether the installed adapter is still coherent.

## Target Sources

- Framework baseline/source: `https://github.com/atvardovsky/AlatyrCore`
- Adapter manifest: `.ai/alatyr.yaml`
- Installation or update note: `.ai/assistant/templates/installation-note.md`
- Project blueprint index: `.ai/project/blueprint.md`
- Business logic layer: `.ai/project/business-logic.md`
- Project source of truth: `README.md, docs/en/reference/*.rst, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, composer.json, tests/README.markdown, and CI workflows`
- Source-of-truth registry: `.ai/project/source-of-truth-registry.md`
- Consistency map: `.ai/project/consistency-map.json`
- Context router: `.ai/assistant/context-router.json`
- Context profiles: `.ai/assistant/context-profiles.md`
- Module profile: `.ai/assistant/module-profile.md`
- Maturity profile: `.ai/assistant/maturity-profile.md`
- Bridge capability matrix: `.ai/assistant/bridge-capability-matrix.md`
- Target validation: `/usr/local/bin/composer8 install`; `/usr/local/bin/php8 -d memory_limit=1G vendor/bin/phpunit`; `/usr/local/bin/php8 -d memory_limit=1G vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan.neon --memory-limit=1G`; `/usr/local/bin/php8 -d memory_limit=1G vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan-dbal3.neon --memory-limit=1G`; `/usr/local/bin/php8 -d memory_limit=1G vendor/bin/phpcs -d memory_limit=1G`; docs validation only after the docs script resolves a PHP 8-compatible composer command
- Supported assistants: `Codex`
- Operation index, catalog, help, routing, health, and preview:
  `.ai/assistant/operation-index.json`,
  `.ai/assistant/operation-catalog.json`, `.ai/assistant/help.md`,
  `.ai/assistant/flows/operation-routing.flow.md`,
  `.ai/assistant/flows/adapter-health.flow.md`,
  `.ai/assistant/templates/pre-change-preview.md`
- Chat-message templates: `.ai/assistant/templates/post-install-message.md`,
  `.ai/assistant/templates/post-update-message.md`
- Migration note template: `.ai/assistant/templates/migration-note.md`
- Durable engineering evidence: `.ai/project/engineering-evidence/README.md`,
  compact index, selected records, task-scale overlay, capture flow, gate, and
  machine template
- Debug Mode when enabled: `.ai/project/debug/README.md`, compact index,
  selected records, task-scale overlay, operation flow, gate, machine record,
  summary template, and linked durable Engineering Evidence index
- Optional module files: check only when the corresponding module is enabled
  in `.ai/assistant/module-profile.md` or `.ai/alatyr.yaml`; missing optional
  files for deferred modules are not health failures.
- Known adapter gaps: `backup owner missing; target-local checker wrapper committed at tools/check_alatyr.py; full optional module graph enabled; local SQLite lacks SQRT for two full PHPUnit tests`

## Steps

1. Treat `AGENTS.md` as preloaded, load the compact bootstrap, and select the
   `framework-upgrade` profile plus only affected adapter areas. Do not load
   all `.ai/project` or `.ai/assistant` files before identifying the recheck
   scope.
2. Identify whether this is a post-installation recheck, framework update
   recheck, bridge compatibility review, or maturity audit.
3. Prepare or review migration assessment evidence before target changes.
   Compare rule registries, installed and next framework files, framework
   version, adapter schema version, template version, and current structural
   validator findings.
4. Use affected canonical sources, rule categories, task profiles, template
   surfaces, bridge capabilities, and local deviations from that assessment to
   select additional context. Do not load the full framework corpus by default.
5. Compare installed framework files against the recorded framework baseline or
   update source.
6. Compare framework version, adapter schema version, template version, module
   states, known gaps, local deviations, and owner facts in `.ai/alatyr.yaml`.
7. Check required core and optional module state in
   `.ai/assistant/module-profile.md`. Require every manifest-enabled module to
   have exactly one `enabled` or `required` profile block, and reject a profile
   block in either state when the manifest does not enable it.
8. Check target adapter references to installed framework files, operation
   help, routing flows, gates, checker rules, operation catalog/index, health
   and preview contracts, root bridge files, durable engineering-evidence
   policy/index/overlay/flow/gate/schema, Debug Mode
   policy/index/overlay/operation/flow/gate/schema/summary when enabled,
   chat-message templates, and final-evidence expectations. Check
   optional-module paths only when the module is enabled or the file is
   present.
9. Check adapter drift hazards: hard-coded local machine paths in `.ai/*`,
   root assistant entry points, bridge files, templates, and policies; stale
   statements about whether local Alatyr or adapter checkers exist; duplicate
   required-context references inside context profiles or router entries;
   missing `.ai/assistant/context-router.json` references where bootstrap
   routing is described; unresolved owner placeholders that are not recorded as
   known gaps; and target-local adapter checker evidence that no longer matches
   repository files.
10. Check project blueprint/source-of-truth ownership, registry entries,
   consistency-map nodes and edges when enabled, exact registry Fact Type to
   node-ID and node-`fact_type` agreement, missing facts, stale relationships,
   and drift. Treat registry, map, consistency routing, measured semantic
   context, and generated bootstrap evidence as one adapter sync set.
    When architecture knowledge is enabled, check catalog ownership, decision
    authority, item states, selected evidence, revision freshness,
    documentation routes, contradictions, and accepted-decision handoff.
11. Check security, live-service, destructive-operation, dependency, credential,
   diagram, generated-artifact, validation, and lifecycle policies.
12. Check task-specific maturity using `.ai/assistant/maturity-profile.md` when
   it exists.
13. Check bridge behavior through `AGENTS.md`, `AI_ASSISTANTS.md`, and any
    installed bridge capability matrix. When diagrams are enabled, verify discussion routing, source/visual
    ownership, inline or artifact capability claims, portable ASCII, and
    stale-view evidence for every supported assistant.
14. When team collaboration is enabled, preserve active task IDs and external
    references; check coordination backend direction, actors and authority,
    stale claims, evidence revisions, concurrent changed-fact overlaps,
    checkpoints, handoffs, decisions, review state, and merge-readiness
    invalidation.
    When change packages are enabled, preserve historical target records and
    check semantic approval fields, companion decisions, correction impact,
    provenance quality, and target validator support.
    Preserve durable engineering-evidence IDs and records, then recheck task
    and repository bindings, index synchronization, canonical-owner links,
    privacy flags, external-patch policy, and existing-record accessibility.
    When Debug Mode is enabled, preserve IDs, records, active-scope evidence,
    events, timing, metrics, and target policy; recheck explicit activation and
    expiry, non-canonical authority, causal attribution, structured
    architectural impacts, direction-change hypothesis/replacement chains,
    privacy, observer effect, exact durable engineering-evidence reference
    resolution, compact index sync, result binding, completed-record
    comparison, clean-upstream projection, and validator support. Never
    reactivate a closed scope during update. Preserve older unstructured events
    as migration-limited evidence instead of inventing classifications.
    When test-first development is enabled, preserve target commands, trigger
    severity, modes, levels, isolation, exceptions, policy revision, and
    historical evidence; recheck recommendation and RED/GREEN routing without
    silently enabling new CI or merge requirements.
    When extensions are enabled, preserve catalog and lock IDs, immutable
    source revisions/digests, target bindings, permissions, approvals, local
    deviations, installed-file ownership, and historical lifecycle evidence;
    recheck compatibility and drift without automatic updates.
15. Identify required migrations, approvals, unresolved facts, and skipped
   checks.
   Recheck `.ai/assistant/policies/action-authorization.json`, root assistant
   entry points, operation request, preview, core gate, final-evidence gate,
   bridge matrix, and conformance scenarios. Confirm subject-only
   issue/backlog transitions remain read-only and prior commit/publish
   authorization is not reusable.
16. Use `.ai/assistant/templates/migration-note.md` when a framework update
    requires target migration evidence.
17. Use `.ai/assistant/templates/effectiveness-report.md` only when comparing
    adapter effectiveness across comparable tasks or adapter states.
18. Run target validation that exists. Do not invent commands.
    Use `migration-staging` only while adapting unresolved target facts. It may
    produce a non-blocking work inventory, but it must not produce `ready`,
    accepted, or complete evidence. Before accepting an installation or update,
    resolve active placeholders and rerun strict `acceptance` validation on the
    checked-out branch/revision.
19. Classify final evidence as `current-state`, `historical-record`, or `mixed`.
    Current files prove current structure only; name dated operation, approval,
    validation, or migration records before making historical claims.
20. Report final evidence and residual risk.

## Final Evidence

Report:

- recheck type
- framework baseline or update source
- migration assessment and affected canonical sources selected from it
- candidate context intentionally omitted with reasons
- framework version, adapter schema version, and template version
- files inspected
- evidence basis, observation time, and repository revision when available
- checked-out branch, validation phase, active unresolved-placeholder count,
  manifest/module-profile agreement, acceptance eligibility, and the final
  strict rerun when staging was used
- historical records used and historical claims that remain unverifiable
- adapter references changed or still current
- action-authorization policy and routed surfaces current, including phase
  separation, scope invalidation, explicit publication intent, delegation
  inheritance, and `current_user_authorization` evidence
- adapter drift checks result, including local path leakage, stale checker
  statements, duplicate profile references, context-router references, owner
  placeholders, and target-local checker evidence

  references, and target-only optimization boundary
- bridge capability matrix status
- diagram discussion presentation, ASCII readability, and source-revision status
- target validation run or unresolved
- approvals needed
- task-specific maturity level and gaps
- migration note created or not needed
- residual risk

## Rejection Criteria

Reject or revise recheck work that:

- claims success without inspecting the installed target adapter
- overwrites target facts just because the source framework changed
- copies Alatyr Core source-repository commands into the target
- ignores supported assistant bridge drift
- hides missing validation, missing approval, or maturity gaps
