# Post-Update Assistant Chat Message

Use this template for the assistant's chat response after Alatyr Core is
updated in `Doctrine ORM`.

Replace placeholders with target facts before sending the message.

```text
Alatyr Core has been updated for `Doctrine ORM`.

Framework baseline:
`https://github.com/atvardovsky/AlatyrCore`

Framework version/schema:
`0.1.0-alpha.15`, adapter schema `14`, template `15`

Updated adapter surfaces:
`none; use only during future updates`

Future assistant bootstrap:
- Do not rely on this chat message alone.
- Treat `AGENTS.md` as preloaded; start from `.ai/assistant/bootstrap-index.json`.
- Repair a stale generated index from `.ai/alatyr.yaml`, `.ai/README.md`, and `.ai/assistant/context-router.json`; otherwise load profiles, module state, registries, blueprint, gate fragments, and the installation note only when routing or unclear adapter state requires them.
- Send `Alatyr` for compact actions or `Alatyr status` for a read-only adapter health check.
- If migration impact is unclear, run `recheck-after-framework-update` before editing files.

Recommended follow-up:
Use the installed Alatyr adapter in this repository.
Operation type: recheck-after-framework-update
Goal: compare the installed adapter against the updated Alatyr Core baseline and report required migrations.
Non-goals: do not change project behavior without approval.
Allowed actions: read-only

Migration assessment:
`.ai/assistant/templates/migration-note.md or manual review`

Upgrade impact router:
`manual review unless a future upgrade report is generated`

Load only canonical sources and target surfaces selected by the migration
assessment. Record candidate context intentionally omitted.

Operation help:
- Send `Alatyr` for compact relevant operations; use `Alatyr status` or
  `Alatyr doctor` for read-only health evidence.
- Exact IDs and aliases route through `.ai/assistant/operation-index.json`;
  bounded natural-language requests route automatically and operation IDs are
  optional. Load the full catalog only for ambiguity or repair.
- Risky or cross-boundary changes show a pre-change preview before edits.
- Use `.ai/assistant/help.md`, `.ai/assistant/help-reference.md`, and `.ai/assistant/templates/operation-request.md` for structured requests.
- Use `large-task` only for cross-boundary or resumable work, and resume an existing packet when one is named.
- Recheck change-package records, semantic approval fields, provenance grades,
  and validator support when the optional module or schema changed. Preserve
  historical target records.
- When code documentation is enabled, preserve target profiles and recheck
  source-set matching, accepted state, canonical owners, generator/output
  policy, adapted skill, and validation before generation.
- When project vocabulary is enabled, preserve term IDs, definitions, states,
  aliases, acronyms, owners, canonical sources, and data links; recheck lookup,
  ambiguity, normalization, adapted skill, and validation before use.
- When test-first development is enabled, preserve target policy ownership,
  triggers, modes, commands, isolation, exceptions, adapted skill, and
  historical evidence; recheck recommendation and RED/GREEN routing before use.
- When extensions are enabled, preserve catalog/lock entries, immutable source
  provenance, target bindings, permissions, approvals, file ownership, local
  deviations, and lifecycle history; recheck compatibility and drift without
  automatically updating, activating, or removing any extension.
- When dependency knowledge is enabled, preserve target policy, reviewed
  package instances, independent semantic state, deviations, retention
  decisions, and permitted snapshots; recheck export API, artifact identity,
  fingerprints, routing, and drift without running package managers,
  activating nested adapters, or presenting stale claims as current.
- When workspace modes are enabled, preserve user-accepted mode IDs,
  per-mode directories, shared root context, relationships, ownership, and
  decision evidence. Recheck them against the revised contract and present
  migrations as proposals; never accept, replace, or activate a mode solely
  because Alatyr was updated.
- When team collaboration is enabled, recheck the structured policy, ignored
  identity boundary, active index, registry/task schemas, backend contract,
  optimistic concurrency, active task IDs, claims, handoffs, decisions,
  external references, stale overlaps, and revision-bound reviews before
  changing active records. Migrate schema-1 arrays atomically when applicable.
- Use `Alatyr set actor <actor>` for local attribution, `Alatyr who am I` to
  inspect it, `Alatyr team status` for coordination evidence, and the specific
  team aliases for task, conflict, handoff, decision, review, or merge work.
- Recheck AI infrastructure router entries and adaptation records when skills, prompts, gates, tools, or bridge contracts changed.
- Recheck `diagram-discussion`, stable diagram lineage, security/privacy and
  external-renderer policy, and each selected compact assistant capability's
  enums, client version, verification time, and evidence when diagram or
  bridge contracts changed.
- Recheck the architecture catalog owner, decision authority, item states,
  selected evidence paths, validation, and evidence revision when
  `architecture-knowledge` or project architecture contracts changed. Use
  `Alatyr architecture` for a bounded inventory, explanation, comparison, or
  review.
- Use `alatyr-suggest-ai <scope>` or `alatyr-improve-ai <item-id>` for a read-only recommendation when project needs or existing item outcomes changed.

Validation run:
`adapter structural validation run; Doctrine runtime tests not run for adapter-only install`

Known adapter gaps or migrations:
`initial install gaps recorded in installation note`

Migration note:
`.ai/assistant/templates/migration-note.md` or `not needed for initial installation`
```
